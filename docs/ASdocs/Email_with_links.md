Hi Sayan,
 
Heather advised that it all can be found in the slides.  Links are available for additional documents in the slides as well. I’ve pasted those links in case they are missed in the slide deck.
 
Is this everything you need? I can follow up with heather if there are additional documents that Caleb showed that aren’t here.
