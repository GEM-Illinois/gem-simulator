These are materials that we are using to plan our development and
experimentation during Summer 2019.

* TBD: project goals

* TBD: module map

* [Project planning template](project-planning-template.md): We will
  fill one of these for every project we begin.

* [Experimental process](experimental-procedure.md): This is an
  outline of steps that we will take in every experiment with the
  vehicle.  We will probably copy and customize this for every
  experiment.
