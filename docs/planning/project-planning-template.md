# < insert Title of activity / software module; Author(s) & Date >

# Synopsis

        Tell the *purpose* of the module or activity, and roughly
        how you will achieve it.

# Personnel

        Tell who will perform the work.  You get 1 point just for
        putting your name here.

# Acceptance criteria

        How will we know when the features and performance meet
        the goals?  The more objective/measurable, the better.

# Solution architecture

        If any diagrams are appropriate, use them.

# Interfaces consumed & produced

        E.g., sensors, input & output messages, user interface. 

        Please link to the input specifications.

        To begin with, mention what agents will consume the output
        and the abstract content of the output.

        Output specs will evolve.  Specify your outputs in as much
        detail as possible.

# Documentation plan

        What documentation do we need for the finished module/activity?
        A user's manual?  Design & implementation overview?

        Consider installation, configuration, user controls,
        diagnostics.

# Software test plan

        How will you verify the quality of your solution and guard
        against regressions during development?

        E.g., unit & integration tests in the simulator or other
        test fixtures.

# Field experiment plan

        How will we evaluate this module using the vehicle in
        real-world conditions?  Does a test course need to be
        constructed?  How many people need to take part in the
        experiment?

# Effort estimate

        Let the architecture, documentation & software test plan
        guide your effort estimate.

        Identify high-level tasks, then subdivide.  Try to subdivide
        until you can picture yourself performing the subtask in
        one day or less.

        Take this opportunity to identify subtasks that you had
        not thought of before.

# Further reading

	If books, journal articles, or web pages will help other
	researchers understand your goal and solution, you may
	mention them here.
